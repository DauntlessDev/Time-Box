# Time-Box
Timebox is a flutter job/time tracker app which is also available for both ios and android devices. I built this so that i would be able to practice different kinds of login, especially facebook and gmail which are both used largely by many people. With this app you can put your job, its tasks and their subtasks and check all of the them in entries page which includes the summary of them and calculates the total of earned money based on time and rate.

I'm very happy while building it, i used blocs with react to combine two streams of data and also conducted unit and widget tests and used mockito for easier testing. For login and storing the data, i used firebase for it. It is built in vscode and is written entirely with dart and flutter.
